Hettinga\" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

It started as an\nattempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and\ncounterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to\ninclude digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky\npower-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in\ncopyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It\ngoes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the\nexceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could\nprohibit the use of interface information essential for software\ninteroperability and competition~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could\nalso require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to\nreconfigure their products.~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by\nthe Copyright Act for identical behaviorThis \"anticounterfeiting\" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights\ntoday!

For membership information see:\nhttp://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching\ntrademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a\nCanadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal\ninformation website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem\nespecially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been\npublished since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued\nby Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.\nQuicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name\nLAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website\nunder that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of\nthe Quicklaw.com website that offers public \"teasers\" in the form of\nsummaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available\nthrough the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian\nlawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially\ndifferent, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed\ncomputer service and the other for information freely available on the\npublic internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more\nproblematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the\nterm LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed\nrequests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark\nauthorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a\nCanadian trademark issued for \"lawsnet.\"Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia\nthrough over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a\ncourt order requiring her to undergo an extensive \"discovery\" process\nthat threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free\nlegal assistance in the past, this next phase will require\nsignificantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can\nmuster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner\nand Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even\nbeen granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is\nunfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,\nand its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and\nuseful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark\nis causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant\nownership in words, especially descriptive words like \"laws\" and \"net\"\nwhen describing an online legal information service. Trademark law\nshould also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal\ninformation (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop\nindividuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free\nlegal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and\npart-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a\nlegal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,\nplease contact:Mr. Gil Lan\nBarrister & Solicitor\n393 University Avenue\nSuite 2000\nToronto, Ontario, M5G 1E6or by email at:\nglan@globalbusinesslaw.comor Ling Xia at:\neditor@lawsnet.com-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Give Twice as Many Gifts this Holiday Season!EFF has signed up with ShopsThatGive.com, a portal site for dozens of\nonline shops that donates a portion of their referral fees to a\ncharity of your choice.

( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are in c , deontic modals in vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature of the complement of a modal : a definite verbal complement with epistemic modals and an indefinite verbal complement with deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : the dichotomy is contextually determined and does not correspond to a syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed . as for argument structure , it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has two different argument structures . if such evidence exists , are these argument structures represented in the lexicon , as in theta-theoretic accounts , or only syntactically ? related questions concern the categorial status of modals ( a special category aux in english , but main verbs in german and dutch ) , the selectional restrictions they impose on their complement ( semantically uniform , but not syntactically : only verbal complements in english , no categorial restrictions in dutch , verbal and certain prepositional complements in german and afrikaans ) . as for their syntactic position at surface structure or lf , we need to know more about the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with negation . it is clear that there is a tight connection between modality and negation / affirmation : many languages have a modal that behaves as an negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . a related issue is the interaction of modals with focus particles , especially those that have a negative or affirmative import , such as english ` only ' or french ` bien ' . it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals . the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis . it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other . although this does not seem to hold in general , question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood . the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals , particulary in view of cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal projections that must be either filled by a modal adverbial in the specifier or by a modal verb in the head . many languages have a construction with ` have to ' or ` be to ' that involves a modal interpretation . such constructions do not generally have an epistemic interpretation ( but consider english ` he was never to see her again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",

         "release of agfl home page this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands",

         "re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted \" overlook \" and \" oversight \" , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's \" outgoing : retiring \" is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of \" oversight \" and \" overlook \" stems largely from their compounding with \" over - \" . \" over \" is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , \" over \" can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in \" get over it \" and \" skip over \" . so my analysis of \" oversight \" and \" overlook \" would be that in one sense , \" over \" takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the \" sight / see / look \" part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as \" see to it \" \" look to your own interest \" seem to carry some of this \" authority \" meaning . i think the \" over \" analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .",

Hettinga\" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

Recently we have learned about a\nCanadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal\ninformation website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem\nespecially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been\npublished since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued\nby Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.\nQuicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name\nLAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website\nunder that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of\nthe Quicklaw.com website that offers public \"teasers\" in the form of\nsummaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available\nthrough the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian\nlawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially\ndifferent, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed\ncomputer service and the other for information freely available on the\npublic internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more\nproblematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the\nterm LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed\nrequests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark\nauthorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a\nCanadian trademark issued for \"lawsnet.\"Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia\nthrough over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a\ncourt order requiring her to undergo an extensive \"discovery\" process\nthat threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free\nlegal assistance in the past, this next phase will require\nsignificantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can\nmuster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner\nand Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even\nbeen granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is\nunfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,\nand its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and\nuseful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark\nis causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant\nownership in words, especially descriptive words like \"laws\" and \"net\"\nwhen describing an online legal information service. Trademark law\nshould also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal\ninformation (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop\nindividuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free\nlegal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and\npart-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a\nlegal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,\nplease contact:Mr. Gil Lan\nBarrister & Solicitor\n393 University Avenue\nSuite 2000\nToronto, Ontario, M5G 1E6or by email at:\nglan@globalbusinesslaw.comor Ling Xia at:\neditor@lawsnet.com-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Give Twice as Many Gifts this Holiday Season!EFF has signed up with ShopsThatGive.com, a portal site for dozens of\nonline shops that donates a portion of their referral fees to a\ncharity of your choice.

         "sle 31 call for papers , sle 31 , st andrews , scotland , 26-30 august 1998 workshop on modality in generative grammar the description and analysis of modality is of central interest to the study of human language . modality interacts with many subsystems of syntax and a better understanding of modality would further our understanding of these subsystems greatly . the relevant subsystems play a role in the existing analyses of the epistemic-deontic dichotomy . this has been attributed to : ( i ) argument structure ( e . g . ross 1969 ) : epistemic modals are one-place predicates ( corresponding to raising verbs syntactically ) , whereas deontic modals are two-place predicates ( corresponding to control verbs syntactically ) . ( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are in c , deontic modals in vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature of the complement of a modal : a definite verbal complement with epistemic modals and an indefinite verbal complement with deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : the dichotomy is contextually determined and does not correspond to a syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed . as for argument structure , it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has two different argument structures . if such evidence exists , are these argument structures represented in the lexicon , as in theta-theoretic accounts , or only syntactically ? related questions concern the categorial status of modals ( a special category aux in english , but main verbs in german and dutch ) , the selectional restrictions they impose on their complement ( semantically uniform , but not syntactically : only verbal complements in english , no categorial restrictions in dutch , verbal and certain prepositional complements in german and afrikaans ) . as for their syntactic position at surface structure or lf , we need to know more about the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with negation . it is clear that there is a tight connection between modality and negation / affirmation : many languages have a modal that behaves as an negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . a related issue is the interaction of modals with focus particles , especially those that have a negative or affirmative import , such as english ` only ' or french ` bien ' . it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals . the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis . it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other . although this does not seem to hold in general , question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood . the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals , particulary in view of cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal projections that must be either filled by a modal adverbial in the specifier or by a modal verb in the head . many languages have a construction with ` have to ' or ` be to ' that involves a modal interpretation . such constructions do not generally have an epistemic interpretation ( but consider english ` he was never to see her again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",

         "release of agfl home page this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands",

         "re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted \" overlook \" and \" oversight \" , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's \" outgoing : retiring \" is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of \" oversight \" and \" overlook \" stems largely from their compounding with \" over - \" . \" over \" is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , \" over \" can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in \" get over it \" and \" skip over \" . so my analysis of \" oversight \" and \" overlook \" would be that in one sense , \" over \" takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the \" sight / see / look \" part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as \" see to it \" \" look to your own interest \" seem to carry some of this \" authority \" meaning . i think the \" over \" analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .",

One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this bothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing these miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them. So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tLee Koo\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCNET Community\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGot suggestions?

A number of Linux distributions wound \nup using egcs, partly derived from the pgcc work as I recall. Happiness \nwas restored to the world with gcc 2.95 and later. > The bottom line is, Pentiums have better instruction sets than\n> the original 386 instructions that they still support.Not really, no. The only instruction of consequence (to gcc anyway) \nsince the i386 was the CMOV introduced with the Pentium Pro. gcc 2.95 \nwill use that instruction if directed to with -march=pentiumpro and you \nwill generally get a few percent improvement out of it. Code compiled \nwith that option will fail on Pentium and earlier processors.> The Pentium also \n> started introducing pipelining so properly generated code can be upto 30% \n> faster than equivulent code that performs the same function!That's the art of instruction scheduling - rearranging the instructions \ngenerated by the compiler such that they make best use of the parallel \n(\"superscalar\") pipelines present in a modern CPU. gcc 2.95 has a fair \ngo at scheduling according to the -mcpu=pentium/pentiumpro option. gcc \n3.1 does a better job, and fine tunes for a few more processors such as \nathlon and athlon-xp. They're in the process of replacing the compiler's \ninstruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even \nbetter job, but that's a ways down the road yet in gcc 3.3.As for the exotic extra instructions sets, gcc 3.1 will make use of SSE \nor SSE2 instructions instead of 387 instructions if you use the \n-mfpmath=sse option and you may see some speed benefit from it, but \nthere's a chance you may also see incompatibilities. gcc will still use \ni387 code for missing functionality in the SSE instruction set (double \nprecision floats for example).AFAIK no current gcc will ever use MMX or 3DNOW! instructions though gcc \n3.1 enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with C \ncode. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get super-fast \nblock copies of memory or RAID math but not much else.> Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed \n> improvements rather than any execution changes.P4 introduced SSE2, a _MUCH_ improved version of SSE and a viable \nreplacement for i387 FPU code. SSE supports only single precision floats \nwhile SSE2 can handle doubles. MMX and SSE shared registers with the FPU \nwhich hobbles them a bit, but SSE2 has its own large, dedicated register \nfile. So far P4 is the only CPU equipped with SSE2. AMD's x86-64 CPUs \nare said to have it as well. Of course x86-64 itself is a whole other \nball game...Paul.-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

Hettinga\" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

For membership information see:\nhttp://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching\ntrademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a\nCanadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal\ninformation website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem\nespecially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been\npublished since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued\nby Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.\nQuicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name\nLAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website\nunder that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of\nthe Quicklaw.com website that offers public \"teasers\" in the form of\nsummaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available\nthrough the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian\nlawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially\ndifferent, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed\ncomputer service and the other for information freely available on the\npublic internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more\nproblematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the\nterm LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed\nrequests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark\nauthorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a\nCanadian trademark issued for \"lawsnet.\"Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia\nthrough over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a\ncourt order requiring her to undergo an extensive \"discovery\" process\nthat threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free\nlegal assistance in the past, this next phase will require\nsignificantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can\nmuster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner\nand Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even\nbeen granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is\nunfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,\nand its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and\nuseful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark\nis causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant\nownership in words, especially descriptive words like \"laws\" and \"net\"\nwhen describing an online legal information service. Trademark law\nshould also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal\ninformation (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop\nindividuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free\nlegal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and\npart-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a\nlegal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,\nplease contact:Mr. Gil Lan\nBarrister & Solicitor\n393 University Avenue\nSuite 2000\nToronto, Ontario, M5G 1E6or by email at:\nglan@globalbusinesslaw.comor Ling Xia at:\neditor@lawsnet.com-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Give Twice as Many Gifts this Holiday Season!EFF has signed up with ShopsThatGive.com, a portal site for dozens of\nonline shops that donates a portion of their referral fees to a\ncharity of your choice.

But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

It started as an\nattempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and\ncounterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to\ninclude digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky\npower-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in\ncopyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It\ngoes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the\nexceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress.

For membership information see:\nhttp://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching\ntrademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a\nCanadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal\ninformation website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem\nespecially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been\npublished since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued\nby Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.\nQuicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name\nLAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website\nunder that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of\nthe Quicklaw.com website that offers public \"teasers\" in the form of\nsummaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available\nthrough the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian\nlawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially\ndifferent, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed\ncomputer service and the other for information freely available on the\npublic internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more\nproblematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the\nterm LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed\nrequests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark\nauthorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a\nCanadian trademark issued for \"lawsnet.\"Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia\nthrough over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a\ncourt order requiring her to undergo an extensive \"discovery\" process\nthat threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free\nlegal assistance in the past, this next phase will require\nsignificantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can\nmuster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner\nand Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even\nbeen granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is\nunfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,\nand its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and\nuseful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark\nis causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant\nownership in words, especially descriptive words like \"laws\" and \"net\"\nwhen describing an online legal information service. Trademark law\nshould also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal\ninformation (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop\nindividuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free\nlegal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and\npart-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a\nlegal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,\nplease contact:Mr. Gil Lan\nBarrister & Solicitor\n393 University Avenue\nSuite 2000\nToronto, Ontario, M5G 1E6or by email at:\nglan@globalbusinesslaw.comor Ling Xia at:\neditor@lawsnet.com-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Give Twice as Many Gifts this Holiday Season!EFF has signed up with ShopsThatGive.com, a portal site for dozens of\nonline shops that donates a portion of their referral fees to a\ncharity of your choice.

( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) .

' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",

' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",
